Extraction of data using SQL

Upon analyzing the database, we find that there are three tables in it, namely:

city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Comprised of columns 'city' and
'country'.
city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC). Comprised of columns
'year', 'city', 'country' and 'avg_temp'.
global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).Comprised of columns 'year'
and 'avg_temp'.


We begin by looking for the city, Delhi (local city) of the country, India in the city_list. We explore the
city_list to see if we can find Delhi using the following command:

SELECT *
FROM city_list
WHERE
city like 'D%';


Upon successfully finding Delhi, we move towards extracting the required data which are, the year and
avg_temp of Delhi from the city_data table; and the avg_temp from the global_data table for our analysis
by using the following JOIN command:

SELECT city_data.year,
city_data.avg_temp
AS delhi_avg_temp,
global_data.avg_temp
AS global_avg_temp
FROM
city_data
INNER JOIN
global_data ON
city_data.year = global_data.year
WHERE
city = 'Delhi'
AND
country = 'India';


We also extract the temperature data of four additional cities namely, London (United Kingdom),
Moscow (Russia), Munich (Germany) and New York along with Delhi and Global temperature data for our
further analysis. We do so by using the following command:

SELECT city_data.*,
global_data.avg_tempAS global_avg_temp
FROM
city_data
INNER JOIN
global_data ON
city_data.year = global_data.year
WHERE
(city = 'Delhi' OR
city = 'London' OR
city = 'Moscow' OR
city = 'Munich' OR
city = 'New York'
AND
(country = 'India' OR
country = 'United Kingdom' OR
country = 'Russia' OR
country = 'Germany' OR
country = 'United States';
